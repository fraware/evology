##### Testing (master)

![Runs](https://github.com/aymericvie/evology/actions/workflows/oop.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)

## Description

We implement an artificial stock market with adaptive trading strategies: an evolutionary market ecology. On a simplified market with assets and cash, we apply various learning algorithms (imitation, Genetic Algorithm, Genetic Programming, ...) to model various means of financial learning. 

## Credits and funding

Code developed by Aymeric Vié with support from Doyne Farmer, Maarten Scholl, Publius Dirac and Louis Vié. This research has been supported by the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Mathematics of Random Systems: Analysis, Modelling and Simulation (EP/S023925/1)

## Documentation

### How to use

To install the libraries we need, run ```setup.py```.

#### Code formatting
We use ```black``` to auto-format the code. After installing with ```pip install black```, go the the ```evology``` folder and run ```black evology``` to auto-format the full folder.
